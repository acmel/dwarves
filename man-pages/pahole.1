.SH NAME
pahole \- Shows, manipulates data structure layout and pretty prints raw data.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpahole\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIfiles\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pahole
shows data structure layouts encoded in debugging information formats,
DWARF, CTF and BTF being supported.

This is useful for, among other things: optimizing important data structures by
reducing its size, figuring out what is the field sitting at an offset from the
start of a data structure, investigating ABI changes and more generally
understanding a new codebase you have to work with.

It also uses these structure layouts to pretty print data feed to its standard
input, e.g.:
.PP
.nf
$ pahole --header elf64_hdr --prettify /lib/modules/5.8.0-rc6+/build/vmlinux
{
	.e_ident = { 127, 69, 76, 70, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
	.e_type = 2,
	.e_machine = 62,
	.e_version = 1,
	.e_entry = 16777216,
	.e_phoff = 64,
	.e_shoff = 604653784,
	.e_flags = 0,
	.e_ehsize = 64,
	.e_phentsize = 56,
	.e_phnum = 5,
	.e_shentsize = 64,
	.e_shnum = 80,
	.e_shstrndx = 79,
},
$
.fi

See the PRETTY PRINTING section for further examples and documentation.

The files must have associated debugging information.  This information may be
inside the file itself, in ELF sections, or in another file.

One way to have this information is to specify the \fB\-g\fR option to the
compiler when building it. When this is done the information will be stored in
an ELF section. For the DWARF debugging information format this, adds, among
others, the \fB.debug_info\fR ELF section. For CTF it is found in just one ELF
section, \fB.SUNW_ctf\fR. BTF comes in at least the \fB.BTF\fR ELF section, and
may come also with the \fB.BTF.ext\fR ELF section.

The \fBdebuginfo\fR packages available in most Linux distributions are also
supported by \fBpahole\fR, where the debugging information is available in a
separate file.

By default, \fBpahole\fR shows the layout of all named structs in the files
specified.

If no files are specified, then it will look if the /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux
is present, using the BTF information present in it about the running kernel,
i.e. this works:
.PP
.nf
$ pahole list_head
struct list_head {
	struct list_head *         next;                 /*     0     8 */
	struct list_head *         prev;                 /*     8     8 */

	/* size: 16, cachelines: 1, members: 2 */
	/* last cacheline: 16 bytes */
};
$
.fi
It is possible to override the /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux file location by setting
the PAHOLE_VMLINUX_BTF_FILENAME environment variable. This may be useful for
testing, scripting when using a different BTF for vmlinux. Used in the pahole
regression tests.

If BTF is not present and no file is passed, then a vmlinux that matches the
build-id for the running kernel will be looked up in the usual places,
including where the kernel debuginfo packages put it, looking for DWARF info
instead.
 
See the EXAMPLES section for more usage suggestions.

It also pretty prints whatever is fed to its standard input, according to the
type specified, see the EXAMPLE session.

Use --count to state how many records should be pretty printed.

.SH OPTIONS
pahole supports the following options.

.TP
.B \-C, \-\-class_name=CLASS_NAMES
Show just these classes. This can be a comma separated list of class names
or file URLs (e.g.: file://class_list.txt)

.TP
.B \-c, \-\-cacheline_size=SIZE
Set cacheline size to SIZE bytes.

.TP
.B \-\-sort
Sort the output by type name, maybe this will grow to allow sorting by other
criteria.

This is mostly needed so that pretty printing from BTF and DWARF can be
comparable when using using multiple threads to load DWARF data, when the order
that the types in the compile units is processed is not deterministic.

.TP
.B \-\-compile
Generate compileable code, with all definitions for all types, i.e.:
.PP
.nf
$ pahole --compile > vmlinux.h
.fi

Produces a header that can be included in a C source file and built. In
the example provided it will use the BTF info if available, otherwise will
look for a DWARF file matching the running kernel build-id.

.TP
.B \-\-skip_emitting_atomic_typedefs
Do not emit 'typedef _Atomic int atomic_int' & friends when used with options
like --compile. Use it if the compiler provides these already, as of circa
2022 with gcc 12.2.1 those are not encoded in DWARF so to generate compilable
code we need emit those typedefs for the atomic types used in the data structures
being emitted from debugging information.

.TP
.B \-\-count=COUNT
Pretty print the first COUNT records from input.

.TP
.B \-\-skip=COUNT
Skip COUNT input records.

.TP
.B \-E, \-\-expand_types
Expand class members. Useful to find in what member of inner structs where an
offset from the beginning of a struct is.

.TP
.B \-F, \-\-format_path
Allows specifying a list of debugging formats to try, in order. Right now this
includes "btf", "ctf" and "dwarf". The default format path used is equivalent to
"-F dwarf,btf,ctf".

.TP
.B \-\-hashbits=BITS
Allows specifying the number of bits for the debugging format loader to use.
The only one affected so far is the "dwarf" one, its default now is 15, the
maximum for it is now 21 bits. Tweak it to see if it improves performance as
the kernel evolves and more types and functions have to be loaded.

.TP
.B \-\-hex
Print offsets and sizes in hexadecimal.

.TP
.B \-r, \-\-rel_offset
Show relative offsets of members in inner structs.

.TP
.B \-p, \-\-expand_pointers
Expand class pointer members.

.TP
.B \-R, \-\-reorganize
Reorganize struct, demoting and combining bitfields, moving members to remove
alignment holes and padding.

.TP
.B \-S, \-\-show_reorg_steps
Show the struct layout at each reorganization step.

.TP
.B \-i, \-\-contains=CLASS_NAME
Show classes that contains CLASS_NAME.

.TP
.B \-\-contains_enumerator=ENUMERATOR_NAME
Show enumeration that contains ENUMERATOR_NAME.
.PP
.nf
  $ pahole --contains_enumerator S_VERSION
  enum file_time_flags {
	  S_ATIME   = 1,
	  S_MTIME   = 2,
	  S_CTIME   = 4,
	  S_VERSION = 8,
  }
  $
.fi

.TP
.B \-a, \-\-anon_include
Include anonymous classes.

.TP
.B \-A, \-\-nested_anon_include
Include nested (inside other structs) anonymous classes.

.TP
.B \-B, \-\-bit_holes=NR_HOLES
Show only structs at least NR_HOLES bit holes.

.TP
.B \-d, \-\-recursive
Recursive mode, affects several other flags.

.TP
.B \-D, \-\-decl_exclude=PREFIX
exclude classes declared in files with PREFIX.

.TP
.B \-f, \-\-find_pointers_to=CLASS_NAME
Find pointers to CLASS_NAME.

.TP
.B \-H, \-\-holes=NR_HOLES
Show only structs with at least NR_HOLES holes.

.TP
.B \-\-padding=SIZE_PADDING
Show only structs with SIZE_PADDING bytes of padding at its end.

.TP
.B \-\-padding_ge=SIZE_PADDING
Show only structs with at least SIZE_PADDING bytes of padding at its end.

.TP
.B \-I, \-\-show_decl_info
Show the file and line number where the tags were defined, if available in
the debugging information.

.TP
.B \-\-skip_encoding_btf_vars
By default, VARs are encoded only for percpu variables. When specified, this
option prevents encoding any VARs. Note that this option can be overridden
by the feature "global_var".

.TP
.B \-\-skip_encoding_btf_decl_tag
Do not encode decl tags in BTF.

.TP
.B \-\-skip_encoding_btf_enum64
Do not encode enum64 in BTF.

.TP
.B \-\-skip_encoding_btf_type_tag
Do not encode type tags in BTF.

.TP
.B \-\-skip_encoding_btf_inconsistent_proto
Do not encode functions with multiple inconsistent prototypes or unexpected register use for their parameters, where the registers used do not match calling conventions.

.TP
.B \-j, \-\-jobs=N
Run N jobs in parallel. Defaults to number of online processors + 10% (like
the 'ninja' build system) if no argument is specified.

.TP
.B \-J, \-\-btf_encode
Encode BTF information from DWARF, used in the Linux kernel build process when
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y is present, introduced in Linux v5.2. Used to implement
features such as BPF CO-RE (Compile Once - Run Everywhere).

See \fIhttps://nakryiko.com/posts/bpf-portability-and-co-re/\fR.

.TP
.B \-\-btf_encode_detached=FILENAME
Same thing as -J/--btf_encode, but storing the raw BTF info into a separate file.

.TP
.B \-\-btf_encode_force
Ignore those symbols found invalid when encoding BTF.

.TP
.B \-\-btf_base=PATH
Path to the base BTF file, for instance: vmlinux when encoding kernel module BTF information.
This may be inferred when asking for a /sys/kernel/btf/MODULE, when it will be autoconfigured
to "/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux".

.TP
.B \-\-btf_gen_floats
Allow producing BTF_KIND_FLOAT entries in systems where the vmlinux DWARF
information has float types.

.TP
.B \-\-btf_gen_optimized
Generate BTF for functions with optimization-related suffixes (.isra, .constprop).

.TP
.B \-\-btf_gen_all
Allow using all the BTF features supported by pahole.

.TP
.B \-\-btf_features=FEATURE_LIST
Encode BTF using the specified feature list, or specify 'default' for all standard features supported.  This option can be used as an alternative to using multiple BTF-related options, and 'default' represents the standard set of BTF features that are in use for kernel BTF generation, so is useful as a shortcut for testing the latest set of standard features.  However kernel builds will call out specific features rather than using 'default' to ensure that the desired features are enabled regardless of pahole version and associated 'default' set.  Supported standard features are

.nf
	encode_force       Ignore invalid symbols when encoding BTF; for example
	                   if a symbol has an invalid name, it will be ignored
	                   and BTF encoding will continue.
	var                Encode percpu variables using BTF_KIND_VAR in BTF.
	float              Encode floating-point types in BTF.
	decl_tag           Encode declaration tags using BTF_KIND_DECL_TAG.
	type_tag           Encode type tags using BTF_KIND_TYPE_TAG.
	enum64             Encode enum64 values with BTF_KIND_ENUM64.
	optimized_func     Encode representations of optimized functions
	                   with suffixes like ".isra.0".
	consistent_func    Avoid encoding inconsistent static functions.
	                   These occur when a parameter is optimized out
	                   in some CUs and not others, or when the same
	                   function name has inconsistent BTF descriptions
	                   in different CUs.
.fi

Supported non-standard features (not enabled for 'default')

.nf
	attributes         Allow generation of decl_tags and type_tags with
	                   kind_flag = 1. These tags can be used to encode
	                   arbitrary compiler attributes in BTF, but are
	                   backward incompatible.
	decl_tag_kfuncs    Inject a BTF_KIND_DECL_TAG for each discovered kfunc.
	distilled_base     For split BTF, generate a distilled version of
	                   the associated base BTF to support later relocation
	                   of split BTF with a possibly changed base, storing
	                   it in a .BTF.base ELF section.
	global_var         Encode all global variables using BTF_KIND_VAR in BTF.
.fi

So for example, specifying \-\-btf_encode=var,enum64 will result in a BTF encoding that (as well as encoding basic BTF information) will contain variables and enum64 values.

.fi

If one wants to add an extra feature to the set of standard ones, the '+' prefix can be used, i.e.:
\-\-btf_features=+reproducible_build will add all default features plus the 'reproducible_build' extra
feature.

.TP
.B \-\-btf_features_strict
Identical to \-\-btf_features above, but pahole will exit if it encounters an unrecognized feature.

.TP
.B \-\-supported_btf_features
Show set of BTF features supported by \-\-btf_features option and exit.  Useful for checking which features are supported since \-\-btf_features will not emit an error if an unrecognized feature is specified.

.TP
.B \-\-running_kernel_vmlinux,
Search for, possibly getting from a debuginfo server, a vmlinux matching the running kernel build-id (from /sys/kernel/notes).

.TP
.B \-l, \-\-show_first_biggest_size_base_type_member
Show first biggest size base_type member.

.TP
.B \-m, \-\-nr_methods
Show number of methods of all classes, i.e. the number of functions have arguments that
are pointers to a given class.

To get the number of methods for an specific class, please use:

  $ pahole --nr_methods | grep -w sock
  sock  1005
  $ 

In the above example it used the BTF information in /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux.

.TP
.B \-M, \-\-show_only_data_members
Show only the members that use space in the class layout. C++ methods will be
suppressed.

.TP
.B \-n, \-\-nr_members
Show number of members.

.TP
.B \-N, \-\-class_name_len
Show size of classes.

.TP
.B \-O, \-\-dwarf_offset=OFFSET
Show tag with DWARF OFFSET.

.TP
.B \-P, \-\-packable
Show only structs that has holes that can be packed if members are reorganized,
for instance when using the \fB\-\-reorganize\fR option.

.TP
.B     \-\-with_flexible_array
Show only structs that have a flexible array.

.TP
.B     \-\-with_embedded_flexible_array
Show only structs that have an embedded flexible array, i.e. a contained struct that has flexible arrays, a flexible array "in the middle".

.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Be quieter.

.TP
.B \-s, \-\-sizes
Show size of classes.

.TP
.B \-t, \-\-separator=SEP
Use SEP as the field separator.

.TP
.B \-T, \-\-nr_definitions
Show how many times struct was defined.

.TP
.B \-u, \-\-defined_in
Show CUs where CLASS_NAME (-C) is defined.

.TP
.B     \-\-flat_arrays
Flatten arrays, so that array[10][2] becomes array[20].
Useful when generating from both CTF/BTF and DWARF encodings
for the same binary for testing purposes.

.TP
.B     \-\-suppress_aligned_attribute
Suppress forced alignment markers, so that one can compare BTF or
CTF output, that don't have that info, to output from DWARF >= 5.

.TP
.B     \-\-suppress_force_paddings

Suppress bitfield forced padding at the end of structs, as this requires
something like DWARF's DW_AT_alignment, so that one can compare BTF or CTF
output, that don't have that info.

.TP
.B     \-\-suppress_packed

Suppress the output of the inference of __attribute__((__packed__)), so that
one can compare BTF or CTF output, the inference algorithm uses things like
DW_AT_alignment, so until it is improved to infer that as well for BTF, allow
disabling this output.

.TP
.B     \-\-fixup_silly_bitfields
Converts silly bitfields such as "int foo:32" to plain "int foo".

.TP
.B \-V, \-\-verbose
be verbose

.TP
.B \-\-ptr_table_stats
Print statistics about ptr_table data structures, used to hold all the types,
tags and functions data structures, for development tuning of such tables, tuned
for a typical 2021 vmlinux file.

.TP
.B \-w, \-\-word_size=WORD_SIZE
Change the arch word size to WORD_SIZE.

.TP
.B \-x, \-\-exclude=PREFIX
Exclude PREFIXed classes.

.TP
.B \-X, \-\-cu_exclude=PREFIX
Exclude PREFIXed compilation units.

.TP
.B \-\-lang=languages
Only process compilation units built from source code written in the specified languages.

Supported languages:

  ada83, ada95, asm, bliss, c, c89, c99, c11, c++, c++03, c++11, c++14, cobol74,
  cobol85, d, dylan, fortran77, fortran90, fortran95, fortran03, fortran08,
  go, haskell, java, julia, modula2, modula3, objc, objc++, ocaml, opencl,
  pascal83, pli, python, renderscript, rust, swift, upc

The linux kernel, for instance, is written in 'c89' circa 2022, use that in filters.

.B \-\-lang_exclude=languages
Don't process compilation units built from source code written in the specified languages.

To filter out compilation units written in Rust, for instance, use:

 pahole -j --btf_encode --lang_exclude rust

This can also be accomplished by setting the environment variable PAHOLE_LANG_EXCLUDE to
the same list of languages, for instance, the following is equivalent to the above:

 export PAHOLE_LANG_EXCLUDE=rust
 pahole -j --btf_encode

Meaning in both cases 'rust' CUs will be skipped.

This is useful for scripts where it provides a way to ask for that exclusion
for pahole and pfunct, no need to use --lang_exclude in all calls to those
tools, just set that environment variable.

.TP
.B \-y, \-\-prefix_filter=PREFIX
Include PREFIXed classes.

.TP
.B \-z, \-\-hole_size_ge=HOLE_SIZE
Show only structs with at least one hole greater or equal to HOLE_SIZE.

.TP
.B \-\-structs
Show only structs, all the other filters apply, i.e. to show just the sizes of all structs
combine --structs with --sizes, etc.

.TP
.B \-\-packed
Show only packed structs, all the other filters apply, i.e. to show just the
sizes of all packed structs combine --packed with --sizes, etc.

.TP
.B \-\-unions
Show only unions, all the other filters apply, i.e. to show just the sizes of all unions
combine --union with --sizes, etc.

.TP
.B \-\-version
Show a traditional string version, i.e.: "v1.18".

.TP
.B \-\-numeric_version
Show a numeric only version, suitable for use in Makefiles and scripts where
one wants to know what if the installed version has some feature, i.e.: 118 instead of "v1.18".

.TP
.B \-\-kabi_prefix=STRING
When the prefix of the string is STRING, treat the string as STRING.

.SH NOTES

To enable the generation of debugging information in the Linux kernel build
process select CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO. This can be done using make menuconfig by
this path: "Kernel Hacking" -> "Compile-time checks and compiler options" ->
"Compile the kernel with debug info". Consider as well enabling
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF by going thru the aforementioned menuconfig path and then
selecting "Generate BTF typeinfo". Most modern distributions with eBPF support
should come with that in all its kernels, greatly facilitating the use of
pahole.

Many distributions also come with debuginfo packages, so just enable it in your
package manager repository configuration and install the kernel-debuginfo, or
any other userspace program written in a language that the compiler generates
debuginfo (C, C++, for instance).

.SH EXAMPLES

All the examples here use either /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux, if present, or lookup
a vmlinux file matching the running kernel, using the build-id info found in
/sys/kernel/notes to make sure it matches.
.P
Show a type:
.PP
.nf
$ pahole -C __u64
typedef long long unsigned int __u64;
$
.fi

.P
Works as well if the only argument is a type name:
.PP
.nf
$ pahole raw_spinlock_t
typedef struct raw_spinlock raw_spinlock_t;
$
.fi

.P
Multiple types can be passed, separated by commas:
.PP
.nf
$ pahole raw_spinlock_t,raw_spinlock
struct raw_spinlock {
	arch_spinlock_t            raw_lock;             /*     0     4 */

	/* size: 4, cachelines: 1, members: 1 */
	/* last cacheline: 4 bytes */
};
typedef struct raw_spinlock raw_spinlock_t;
$
.fi

.P
Types can be expanded:
.PP
.nf
$ pahole -E raw_spinlock
struct raw_spinlock {
        /* typedef arch_spinlock_t */ struct qspinlock {
                union {
                        /* typedef atomic_t */ struct {
                                int counter;                                                  /*     0     4 */
                        } val;                                                                /*     0     4 */
                        struct {
                                /* typedef u8 -> __u8 */ unsigned char locked;                /*     0     1 */
                                /* typedef u8 -> __u8 */ unsigned char pending;               /*     1     1 */
                        };                                                                    /*     0     2 */

                                /* typedef u16 -> __u16 */ short unsigned int tail;           /*     2     2 */
                        };                                                                    /*     0     4 */
                };                                                                            /*     0     4 */
        } raw_lock;                                                                           /*     0     4 */

        /* size: 4, cachelines: 1, members: 1 */
        /* last cacheline: 4 bytes */
};
$
.fi

.P
When decoding OOPSes you may want to see the offsets and sizes in hexadecimal:
.PP
.nf
$ pahole --hex thread_struct

pahole can also use the data structure types to pretty print raw data specified via --prettify.
To consume raw data from the standard input, just use '--prettify -'

It can also pretty print raw data from stdin according to the type specified:
.PP

$ pahole -C modversion_info drivers/scsi/sg.ko
struct modversion_info {
      long unsigned int          crc;                  /*     0     8 */

Pretty print according to this class. Arguments may be passed to it to affect how
the pretty printing is performed, e.g.:

.PP
.nf
    -C 'perf_event_header(sizeof,type,type_enum=perf_event_type,filter=type==PERF_RECORD_EXIT)'
.fi

This would select the 'struct perf_event_header' as the type to use to pretty print records
states that the 'size' field in that struct should be used to figure out the size of the record
(variable sized records), that the 'enum perf_event_type' should be used to pretty print the
numeric value in perf_event_header->type and furthermore that it should be used to heuristically
look for structs with the same name (lowercase) of the enum entry that is converted from the
type field, using it to pretty print instead of the base 'perf_event_header' type. See the
PRETTY PRINTING EXAMPLES section below.
.P

Furthermore the 'filter=' part can be used, so far with only the '==' operator to filter based
on the 'type' field and converting the string 'PERF_RECORD_EXIT' to a number according to
type_enum.
.P

The 'sizeof' arg defaults to the 'size' member name, if the name is different, one can use
 'sizeof=sz' form, ditto for 'type=other_member_name' field, that defaults to 'type'.

Looking at the ELF header for a vmlinux file, using BTF, first lets discover the ELF header type:
.PP
.nf
$ pahole --sizes | grep -i elf | grep -i _h
elf64_hdr	64	0
elf32_hdr	52	0
$ 
.fi
.P
Now we can use this to show the first record from offset zero:
.PP
.nf
$ pahole -C elf64_hdr --count 1 --prettify /lib/modules/5.8.0-rc3+/build/vmlinux
{
	.e_ident = { 127, 69, 76, 70, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
	.e_type = 2,
	.e_machine = 62,
	.e_version = 1,
	.e_entry = 16777216,
	.e_phoff = 64,
	.e_shoff = 775923840,
	.e_flags = 0,
	.e_ehsize = 64,
	.e_phentsize = 56,
	.e_phnum = 5,
	.e_shentsize = 64,
	.e_shnum = 80,
	.e_shstrndx = 79,
},
$
.fi
.P
This is equivalent to:
.PP
.nf
$ pahole --header elf64_hdr --prettify /lib/modules/5.8.0-rc3+/build/vmlinux
.fi
.P
The --header option also allows reference in other command line options to fields in the header.
This is useful when one wants to show multiple records in a file and the range where those fields
are located is specified in header fields, such as for perf.data files:
.PP
.nf
$ pahole --hex ~/bin/perf --header perf_file_header --prettify perf.data
{
	.magic = 0x32454c4946524550,
	.size = 0x68,
	.attr_size = 0x88,
	.attrs = {
		.offset = 0xa8,
		.size = 0x88,
	},
	.data = {
		.offset = 0x130,
		.size = 0x588,
	},
	.event_types = {
		.offset = 0,
		.size = 0,
	},
	.adds_features = { 0x16717ffc, 0, 0, 0 },
},
$
.fi
.P
So to display the cgroups records in the perf_file_header.data section we can use:
.PP
.nf
$ pahole ~/bin/perf --header=perf_file_header --seek_bytes '$header.data.offset' --size_bytes='$header.data.size' -C 'perf_event_header(sizeof,type,type_enum=perf_event_type,filter=type==PERF_RECORD_CGROUP)' --prettify perf.data
{
	.header = {
		.type = PERF_RECORD_CGROUP,
		.misc = 0,
		.size = 40,
	},
	.id = 1,
	.path = "/",
},
{
	.header = {
		.type = PERF_RECORD_CGROUP,
		.misc = 0,
		.size = 48,
	},
	.id = 1553,
	.path = "/system.slice",
},
{
	.header = {
		.type = PERF_RECORD_CGROUP,
		.misc = 0,
		.size = 48,
	},
	.id = 8,
	.path = "/machine.slice",
},
{
	.header = {
		.type = PERF_RECORD_CGROUP,
		.misc = 0,
		.size = 128,
	},
	.id = 7828,
	.path = "/machine.slice/libpod-42be8e8d4eb9d22405845005f0d04ea398548dccc934a150fbaa3c1f1f9492c2.scope",
},
{
	.header = {
		.type = PERF_RECORD_CGROUP,
		.misc = 0,
		.size = 88,
	},
	.id = 13,
	.path = "/machine.slice/machine-qemu\\x2d1\\x2drhel6.sandy.scope",
},
$ 
.fi
.P
For the common case of the header having a member that has the 'offset' and 'size' members, it is possible to use this more compact form:
.PP
.nf
$ pahole ~/bin/perf --header=perf_file_header --range=data -C 'perf_event_header(sizeof,type,type_enum=perf_event_type,filter=type==PERF_RECORD_CGROUP)' --prettify perf.data
.fi
.P
This uses ~/bin/perf to get the type definitions, the defines 'struct perf_file_header' as the header,
then seeks '$header.data.offset' bytes from the start of the file, and considers '$header.data.size' bytes
worth of such records. The filter expression may omit a common prefix, in this case it could additionally be
equivalently written as both 'filter=type==CGROUP' or the 'filter=' can also be omitted, getting as compact
as 'type==CGROUP':
.P
If we look at:
.PP
.nf
$ pahole ~/bin/perf -C perf_event_header
struct perf_event_header {
	__u32                      type;                 /*     0     4 */
	__u16                      misc;                 /*     4     2 */
	__u16                      size;                 /*     6     2 */

	/* size: 8, cachelines: 1, members: 3 */
	/* last cacheline: 8 bytes */
};
$ 
.fi
.P
And:
.PP
.nf
$ pahole ~/bin/perf -C perf_event_type
enum perf_event_type {
	PERF_RECORD_MMAP = 1,
	PERF_RECORD_LOST = 2,
	PERF_RECORD_COMM = 3,
	PERF_RECORD_EXIT = 4,
	PERF_RECORD_THROTTLE = 5,
	PERF_RECORD_UNTHROTTLE = 6,
	PERF_RECORD_FORK = 7,
	PERF_RECORD_READ = 8,
	PERF_RECORD_SAMPLE = 9,
	PERF_RECORD_MMAP2 = 10,
	PERF_RECORD_AUX = 11,
	PERF_RECORD_ITRACE_START = 12,
	PERF_RECORD_LOST_SAMPLES = 13,
	PERF_RECORD_SWITCH = 14,
	PERF_RECORD_SWITCH_CPU_WIDE = 15,
	PERF_RECORD_NAMESPACES = 16,
	PERF_RECORD_KSYMBOL = 17,
	PERF_RECORD_BPF_EVENT = 18,
	PERF_RECORD_CGROUP = 19,
	PERF_RECORD_TEXT_POKE = 20,
	PERF_RECORD_MAX = 21,
};
$
.fi
.P
And furthermore:
.PP
.nf
$ pahole ~/bin/perf -C perf_record_cgroup
struct perf_record_cgroup {
	struct perf_event_header   header;               /*     0     8 */
	__u64                      id;                   /*     8     8 */
	char                       path[4096];           /*    16  4096 */

	/* size: 4112, cachelines: 65, members: 3 */
	/* last cacheline: 16 bytes */
};
$
.fi
.P
Then we can see how the perf_event_header.type could be converted from a __u32 to a string (PERF_RECORD_CGROUP).
If we remove that type_enum=perf_event_type, we will lose the conversion of 'struct perf_event_header' to the
more descriptive 'struct perf_record_cgroup', and also the beautification of the header.type field:
.PP
.nf
$ pahole ~/bin/perf --header=perf_file_header --seek_bytes '$header.data.offset' --size_bytes='$header.data.size' -C 'perf_event_header(sizeof,type,filter=type==19)' --prettify perf.data
{
	.type = 19,
	.misc = 0,
	.size = 40,
},
{
	.type = 19,
	.misc = 0,
	.size = 48,
},
{
	.type = 19,
	.misc = 0,
	.size = 48,
},
{
	.type = 19,
	.misc = 0,
	.size = 128,
},
{
	.type = 19,
	.misc = 0,
	.size = 88,
},
$
.fi
.P
Some of the records are not found in 'type_enum=perf_event_type' so some of the records don't get converted to a type that fully shows its contents. For perf we know that those are in another enumeration, 'enum perf_user_event_type', so, for these cases, we can create a 'virtual enum', i.e. the sum of two enums and then get all those entries decoded and properly casted, first few records with just 'enum perf_event_type':
.PP
.nf
$ pahole ~/bin/perf --header=perf_file_header --seek_bytes '$header.data.offset' --size_bytes='$header.data.size' -C 'perf_event_header(sizeof,type,type_enum=perf_event_type)' --count 4 --prettify perf.data
{
	.type = 79,
	.misc = 0,
	.size = 32,
},
{
	.type = 73,
	.misc = 0,
	.size = 40,
},
{
	.type = 74,
	.misc = 0,
	.size = 32,
},
{
	.header = {
		.type = PERF_RECORD_CGROUP,
		.misc = 0,
		.size = 40,
	},
	.id = 1,
	.path = "/",
},
$
.fi
.P
Now with both enumerations, i.e. with 'type_enum=perf_event_type+perf_user_event_type':
.PP
.nf
$ pahole ~/bin/perf --header=perf_file_header --seek_bytes '$header.data.offset' --size_bytes='$header.data.size' -C 'perf_event_header(sizeof,type,type_enum=perf_event_type+perf_user_event_type)' --count 5 --prettify perf.data

		.size = 32,
	},
	.time_shift = 31,
	.time_mult = 1016803377,
	.time_zero = 435759009518382,
},
{
	.header = {
		.type = PERF_RECORD_THREAD_MAP,
		.misc = 0,
		.size = 40,
	},
	.nr = 1,
	.entries = 0x50 0x7e 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00,

		.misc = 0,
		.size = 48,
	},
	.id = 1553,
	.path = "/system.slice",
},
$
.fi
.P
It is possible to pass multiple types, one has only to make sure they appear in the file
in sequence, i.e. for the perf.data example, see the perf_file_header dump above, one can print
the perf_file_attr structs in the header attrs range, then the perf_event_header in the
data range with the following command:
.PP
.nf
pahole ~/bin/perf --header=perf_file_header \
         -C 'perf_file_attr(range=attrs),perf_event_header(range=data,sizeof,type,type_enum=perf_event_type+perf_user_event_type)' --prettify perf.data
